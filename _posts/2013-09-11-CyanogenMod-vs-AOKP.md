##CyanogenMod 10.1 Pros

- Stock Android with just the right amount of customizable options to attract new users
- Comes pre-installed with a beautiful lock screen widget – cLock
- In-built Profiles support
- Comes with a limited version of Pie Controls as seen on Paranoid Android
- The ability to disable Root access to apps or over adb temporarily
- Daily nightly builds that are much more stable than even AOKP’s Builds

The customization options in AOKP ROM are just insane. Please take a deep breath before reading the list below.

- Lock screen ribbon
- AOKP Ribbon – An Ubuntu Mobile like sidebar that you can swipe from the corner of the screen to get quick access to your favorite apps. You can even directly access all the apps installed on your phone via this, thus providing the ability to use your phone without a launcher.
- While even CM10.1 has lock screen shortcuts, AOKP ROM allows for more shortcuts (5 vs. 7). The same is true for Quick launch shortcuts (3 vs. 5).
- Navigator bar customization – You can add a shortcut on the navigation bar like on CM10.1, but AOKP ROM allows for far more control over what you want to do. It also allows you to set shortcuts on long pressing of a key on the navigation bar 导航栏自定义化
- The ability to re-size the navigation bar 
- The ability to auto-hide the navigation bar after a certain period of inactivity
- Ability to change the navigation bar icons
- Navigation bar widgets
- While CM10.1 also allows you to customize Quick Settings, AOKP allows much more customization options
- Dual Panel (Tablet UI) mode for the navigation bar
- Dual panel mode for certain inbuilt apps
- Notification bar ribbon and widgets
- Ability to display the battery status as a small bar on the navigation bar
- Custom notification background
- Custom boot animation 
- Custom vibrations for each app or contact
- The ability to make the Status bar and navigation bar transparent 状态栏和导航栏透明
- Ability to set custom toggles in Quick Settings
- Permissions Management
- Ability to put the Status bar clock in the Center
- Ability to set long press actions to items in the Quick Settings menu
- Swagger
- Phew! That’s not all though. There are a lot of other customization options that AOKP has, which I have not listed above. If the above options don’t convince you, I doubt the rest will. However, the ROM does have a few cons that are listed below. AOKP Cons

Nightly builds can be a bit unstable, but then they are nightly builds. However, for some people this can be a deal breaker

- No in-built Pie Launcher or any other similar implementation
- No Profiles feature
- Limited device support
- No central download center for nightly and milestone releases

##Conclusion

If after reading the above post, you are still confused, I would suggest you to simply try out both the ROMs. Also, keep in mind that the pros of one ROM automatically becomes the cons of another, and vice-versa. There is no difference in battery life between both the ROMs, since both the ROMs are generally based on a slightly modified stock kernel.

However, users may slight performance difference between both the ROMs on the same device. Ideally, there should not really be any performance difference between both the ROMs, since AOKP is based on CyanogenMod’s device tree. From the above comparison, it should be quite clear that the CyanogenMod team is no longer in the race to offer the most customizable custom ROM.

Instead, their goal is now to offer a ROM that behaves and looks like stock, but comes with some basic customization options. On the other hand, one of main goals of AOKP ROM is to offer its users the ability to customize each and every aspect of the Android OS running on their device.
